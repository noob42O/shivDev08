# mylistking

Welcome to the List King!

This mobile designed web app allows you to add items to a list, click to mark complete, and click again to delete...all the while keeping a running count of items.

Note to my Web Developer: 
Hey, thanks for help, these changes need to get to the client…I had most working but now all looks wrong, start with the listking.html page & I’ve left numbered comments & my initials, if you can fix it, add to my comment noting what you did. 

could you make your changes obvious so I can look back over it and see? (Don't delete my comments.) 

btw: i’m 99.9999% sure there are no semicolon (;) errors. Those are SO hard to find. I double- and triple-checked to make sure these weren't a problem.
